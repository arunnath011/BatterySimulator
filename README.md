# BatterySimulator
Python-based battery test data simulator that generates realistic lithium-ion battery cycling data for development, testing, and demonstration purposes. The simulator will produce CSV output files mimicking real battery cycler formats (Arbin, Neware, Biologic) to support the battery data analytics platform without requiring physical hardware.
